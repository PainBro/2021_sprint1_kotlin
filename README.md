This is a simple Kotlin app for an android device it is a timed clicker game. once you click the start button you will have 10 seconds to click the click button as many times as you can. it counts the clicks, and depending on how many you get displays a little message.

The purpose for writing this program was both to learn the Kotlin language and to get to know the android studio IDE.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
